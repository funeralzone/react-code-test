# Funeral Zone React Test #

Seems like one of our developers made a few mistakes while trying to build a ToDo app. It will be up to you to get this app running and figure out a few bugs within and other problems that you might find in the codebase.

After fixing all of the problems that you can find, you can gain some bonus points by making our ToDos sortable. It will be completely up to you on how to do that.

1. Make sure to have `yarn` install globally: `npm install -g yarn`
2. Install external dependencies using `yarn install`
3. Start the app with `yarn start`
